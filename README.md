# TypeScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my TypeScript learning journey! This GitHub repository documents my progress as I deepen my understanding of TypeScript and enhance my skills through daily practices. The goal is to become proficient in TypeScript and use it effectively in projects, ultimately improving my development skills and making valuable contributions to the community.

## Goals

2. **Documentation Reading**: Explore the official TypeScript documentation to learn new concepts.
3. **Sample Project Work**: Work on a small sample project to apply practical usage of TypeScript.
4. **Code Reviews**: Review TypeScript projects on GitHub to understand and learn from others' code.
5. **Note-taking**: Document new concepts and practices learned during the day.
